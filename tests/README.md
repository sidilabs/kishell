# End-to-end testing setup

Spin up a single node Elasticsearch cluster including Kibana to perform end-to-end testing.

Elasticsearch available at http://localhost:9200/ and Kibana at http://localhost:5601.

## How to

First spin up the test stack:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

Once it is done, configure kishell to be able to query from it:

```
TODO
```

Now it is possible to query the data with a know expected result.
